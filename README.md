# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Full Stack JS Path of The Odin Project - the fourth

Well, that was some hard work for me.

It's not that difficult for me to understand Factories and Modules, but it's not that easy to use them sensibly.

But the goal was also to make a working tic-tac-toe game and it runs, I think, in its own little bubble...

For the minimax algorithm, I found some help here:

The first two videos belong together, are in German (also helpful for me) and made for Python.

So, here it is:

+ Hidden menu - click on the small triangle... or the name of the game.

+ The 'X' always starts(!), thus the player(s) alternately play X's and O's

+ 'Incognito' & 'Anonymous' as default names or optionally individual named players

+ AI's name is 'DeepThought', of course...

+ Easy peasy - you can always win - One Player Mode

+ Unbeatable - you will never win - AI
